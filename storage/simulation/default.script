# This file is a script file for the simulator. A script file is designed to
# alter the cluster in order to simulate how repairing/rebalancing will react.
# Script files contain a list of operations. Each operation should have the
# following format:
# Operation[-Option] First Last Every Repeat
#
# Operation (required) is the operation type, there is a list of them at the
#   end of this file.
# Option is an optional value for the operation. Not all operations require an
#   option.
# First (required) is the first simulation epoch in which the operation will
#   occur.
# Last is the last simulation epoch in which the operation can occur. This
#   value is only important to operations that occur at more than one epoch. If
#   not supplied, it has a default value of 0 which will ensure that operation
#   only occurs at the First epoch.
# Every is how often an operation will occur. If set to 1, it will occur on
#   every epoch between First and Last. If set to 2, it will occur on every
#   other epoch. If not supplied, it defaults to 0, which means that the
#   operation will only occur once at the first epoch.
# Repeat is how many times the operation occurs at each epoch in which fires.
#   The default value for repeat is 1, which means that the operation will only
#   happen once.
#
# Blank lines and lines starting with # are ignored during parsing. The order
# of the operations does not matter as script files are fully parsed before
# starting the simulation. If you would like to have a repeat but don't need a
# Last or Every, just put in the default values for those.

# Available Operations and their variants:
# AddNode -- adds a new node with a new store
# SplitRange-First -- splits the first range
# SplitRange-Last -- splits the last range
# SplitRange-Random -- splits a random range
# SplitRange-X -- splits range number X
# Exit -- Signals that the cluster should exit after this final epoch
